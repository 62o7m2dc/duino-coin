# Message to Duino Users

Hello Duino users. While my last message was addressed to the administration and maintainers, I am now writing to you. Yesterday, thanks to our coordinated work, we managed to cause a ruckus in the most censored place in this project - the official Discord. Now you will find almost no mention of what happened, and all participants except moderators have been banned.

## The Aftermath

- There is no doubt who panicked and closed the issue on GitHub and deleted and banned everyone on Discord.
- There is no doubt who exactly ignored what happened and made no comment whatsoever.
- The moderation team was convinced it was a "phishing" or "scam".

## The Puzzle

I'm not asking you to do anything or prove anything. Put this simple puzzle together and come to your own conclusion.

- What project you donate to, who you give servers to to keep that project running.
- Who you share your data with.

## The Wallet and Server Source Code

- Wallet on Coin Magi, which is an integral part of the fraudulent Duino-Coin project, does not even give out private keys or passphrases. You are simply depositing money into someone else's wallet using these solutions.
- The server source code is not public. You cannot create your own miners or wallets.

## The Kolka System

- This is either forbidden by the very poorly written Kolka system, which breaks when using third party software.
- And even bans and warnings from this Kolka did not help.

## The Requirements

- You are forced to send a photo of each of your boards, each of your miners with a piece of paper.

## Final Thoughts

And now, at the end, think about what you have read. Draw your own conclusions. Thank you.
